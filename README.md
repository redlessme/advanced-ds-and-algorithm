# advanced-ds-and-algorithm
A really challeging course I study so far! Topics include amortized analysis, advanced sorting and searching algorithms, new tree/string/graph data structures and algorithms, and number-theoretic algorithms amongst others.
- A1: Z algorithm, Boyer Moore, modified KMP algorithm
A2: Fibonacci heap, ukennon
A3: lzss compressed algorithm
